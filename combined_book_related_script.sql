    Book-Related Setup Script
    This script consolidates all SQL operations related to book tables for the BookStore-Database-Project on the brian branch.
    It includes database initialization, creation of book-related tables, test data insertion, example queries, and a data manipulation query.
    These operations are specific to book-related entities to avoid overlap with teammates' tasks (e.g., customer and order tables).
    A final combined script (bookstoreDB.sql) will be created after merging with team contributions.

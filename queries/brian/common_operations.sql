/*
Explanation:

    Query 1: Joins book, book_language, and publisher to display each bookâ€™s title, language, publisher, and price.
    Query 2: Uses the book_author junction table to find all books by a specific author (Jane Austen, author_id = 1).
    Query 3: Identifies authors who have written books in a specific language (English, language_id = 1), using DISTINCT to avoid duplicates.
    Query 4: Lists books published by a specific publisher (Penguin Books, publisher_id = 1).
    Query 5: Counts the number of books in each language, using a LEFT JOIN to include languages with zero books.
